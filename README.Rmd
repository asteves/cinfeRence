## Installation

You can install the released version of learncausalinfeRence from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("asteves/cinfeRence")
```

There are two ways to start tutorials. In RStudio 1.3 or later, you will find tutorials listed in the "Tutorial" tab in the top-right pane (by default). Find a tutorial and click "Start Tutorial" to begin. Alternatively, you can run any tutorial from the R console by typing:

``` r
learnr::run_tutorial("TUTORIAL_OF_INTEREST", package = "cinfeRence")
```

For example: 

```r
learnr::run_tutorial("00-intro", package="cinfeRence")
```

will bring up the Introduction tutorial in your default web browser. You can see the full list of tutorials in the package from the R console by typing:

``` r
learnr::available_tutorials("cinfeRence")
```

## Submission Reports 

At the end of each tutorial, students can download submission reports that describe what questions and exercises they attempted. These pdfs can be uploaded to a learning management system like Gradescope.
